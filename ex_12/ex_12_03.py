# Exercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.

import urllib.request

url = input('Enter URL: ')
fileHandle = urllib.request.urlopen(url)

received = fileHandle.read().decode()
print(received[:3000])
print('Total number of characters:', len(received))
